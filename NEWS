Release Notes for CDimg|tools version/0.3
-----------------------------------------

This is the first (official) public release of CDimg|tools.  All the changes
since the previous release were made only to make the package suitable for
public release.

Updates since version/0.2
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

* Packaging changes

  - The package's ``pretty name'' has been changed from CDimgtools to
    CDimg|tools.
  - The release archives created by Makefile include the generated
    documentation files by default.
  - ChangeLog is the new name of the changelog; it is generated by a new helper
    script gitchangelog.sh; its syntax is now closer to a standard GNU
    ChangeLog.
  - The configure script warns about missing Perl modules required at runtime.
  - The package has been adapted to build under BSD; see 'INSTALL.NetBSD'.
  - The manual pages are installed gzipped.

* The documentation has been updated to point to the new online resources and
