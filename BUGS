Issues
------

Known bugs and limitations:

* The image formats handled by some tools are not open: their logic can only
  be guessed from sample files.  Consequently there can be absolutely no
  guarantee that a tool can handle all files of the same formats appropriately.

* For bugs and limitations specific to a particular command, see its manual
  page.

* Bugs recently discovered or other minor bugs may be listed online at
  <https://gna.org/bugs/?group=cdimgtools>.
