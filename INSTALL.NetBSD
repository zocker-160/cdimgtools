See 'INSTALL' first.

If the dependencies are in the standard pkgsrc locations, make sure that
+/usr/pkg/bin+ is in your `PATH` and build like this, possibly adding other
desired options:

[source,sh]
$ ./configure MAKE=gmake CPPFLAGS="-I/usr/pkg/include" \
    LDFLAGS="-L/usr/pkg/lib -R/usr/pkg/lib" --mandir='${prefix}/man'
$ gmake
