NAME
----
dvdimgdecss - CSS descrambling of raw DVD Video images


SYNOPSIS
--------
[verse]
*dvdimgdecss* *-V*
*dvdimgdecss* [*-v*|*-q*] [*-c*] [*--*] 'dvd'
*dvdimgdecss* [*-v*|*-q*] [*-c*|*-C*] [*--*] 'dvd' 'file'


DESCRIPTION
-----------
`dvdimgdecss` is a command line program to remove the CSS scrambling of DVD
Video image files.

dvdimgdecss uses libdvdread and libdvdcss, and passes them 'dvd' as is.  'dvd'
can be a drive device file or a raw image file.

If 'file' is not given, dvdimgdecss only computes (and prints) the sector
ranges corresponding to each file pertaining to the DVD Video.

If 'file' is given, it furthermore copies 'dvd' to 'file', possibly decrypting
the sector ranges corresponding to VOB files.  The actual reading and
decryption is done by libdvdcss.


OPTIONS
-------
*-V*::
	Print the version information and exit.

*-v*, *-q*::
	Increase or decrease the level of verbosity of messages printed to
	stdout/stderr.  The default level is 1, at which only error messages are
	printed.  At level 0 nothing is printed.  At level 2, each domain (title)
	is displayed as it is processed.  At level 3, a percentage indicator is
	displayed.
	The messages printed by libdvdcss are controlled by the environment
	variable 'DVDCSS_VERBOSE'; libdvdread's messages cannot be silenced.

*-c*::
	Make libdvdread search for all the title keys and print the result; while
	copying and decrypting the 'dvd', enable some consistency checks made by
	using libdvdread.
	While decrypting, libdvdcss will nonetheless retrieve the title keys again;
	if the cache directory is in use, the keys will simply be read from it.

*-C*::
	Use libdvdread instead of libdvdcss for reading (and decrypting) the VOB
	streams of the 'dvd'.  This implies *-c*, and avoids a new search of the
	title keys by libdvdcss.  It is not known (yet) whether libdvdread perform
	additional checks (compared to libdvdcss alone).


ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES
---------------------
DVDCSS_*::
	libdvdcss' environment variables.

DVDREAD_NOKEYS::
	libdvdread's environment variable.  Setting this variable prevents
	libdvdread from trying to retrieve all the title keys at once, even when
	the option *-c* is given.


FILES
-----
~/.dvdcss::
	libdvdcss' default cache directory for the title keys.  Setting
	`DVDCSS_CACHE=off` in the environment disables the use of the cache.


EXIT STATUS
-----------
To be interpreted as a bitmask, where each bit set indicates a failure.
Because a usage error always sets all the other bits, the values between 128
and 254 remain unused; they constitute a range often used by shells (e.g. bash
or older versions of ksh) to indicate an abnormal process termination (killed
by a signal).

*0*::
	No errors.

*255*::
	Usage error (invalid option or wrong number of arguments).

*64*::
	I/O error.  If a file could not be opened, the exit status is 127.

*32*::
	Inconsistencies found (probably because of a bug in dvdimgdecss or its
	libraries).

*16*::
	Cancellation due to a memory allocation error.

*8*::
	No VOBs were found in the DVD; the output file is the same as the 'dvd' if
	there are no other errors.


EXAMPLES
--------
If the disc can be read without errors, reading directly from the drive has the
advantage of making the disc key available to libdvdcss:

[source,sh]
dvdimgdecss /dev/sr0 dvd.img

It is possible to decrypt a file without a drive (without a disc key);
furthermore, we bypass the key cache and make libdvdcss print the new keys
found:

[source,sh]
DVDCSS_VERBOSE=2 DVDCSS_CACHE=off dvdimgdecss dvd.img dvd.img.decss

You might then burn the image to an optical disc.


BUGS
----
It seems, after a look at its source code, that libdvdcss does not report all
the error conditions that it encounters.
