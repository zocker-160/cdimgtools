Description: command line tools to inspect and manipulate certain CD/DVD image files
 CDimg|tools is a set of command line tools to inspect and manipulate CD/DVD
 optical disc images of formats uncommon on free UNIX-like systems (like
 GNU/Linux or BSD).
 .
  * raw96cdconv:
    This command is a Perl script that demultiplexes/multiplexes stream data
    (audio, raw data or .iso format data) and sub-channel data from a RAW+96
    image file.  It handles optical disc images containing stream data and
    sub-channel data of a given sector at contiguous positions; this kind of
    image file may be either directly created by a ripping program like
    readcd(1) or cdrdao(1), or extracted from another image file by nrgtool(1).
 .
  * nrgtool:
    This command is a Perl script that reads .nrg images (created by Nero),
    prints the metadata about the image, and extracts, for each track, the raw
    data to a separate file; disc types such as CDDA, CD-extra and
    (multi-session) CD-ROM/DVD-ROM are supported.
 .
  * cssdec:
    This command decrypts CSS-scrambled VOB files or streams found on DVD Video
    discs; the title key is obtained transparently by libdvdcss.
 .
  * dvdimgdecss:
    This command decrypts CSS-scrambled DVD Video discs or image files; it
    writes a similar image file containing the same data at the same location;
    the UDF filesystem of the disc is left intact.
