NAME
----
cssdec - simple CSS descrambler using libdvdcss


SYNOPSIS
--------
[verse]
*cssdec* *-V*
*cssdec* ['options'] [*--*]  'target' ['start_sector' ['end_sector']]
*cssdec* *-k* ['options'] [*--*]  'target' ['start_sector']


DESCRIPTION
-----------
`cssdec` is a command line program to decrypt sectors of CSS scrambled VOB
files.  The processed data is output on stdout.

`cssdec` uses libdvdcss directly, and passes it 'target' as is.  'target' can
be a drive device file or a normal file.

The chosen block to be decrypted should be a VOB stream encrypted with a single
key; it can be a whole video file copied as is from a mounted DVD disc, or a
range of sectors of a DVD disc (or of an image thereof) containing a single
title (or menu).  The sector numbers are computed from the command line
arguments by the function strtol(3).

The title key used to decrypt the VOB stream is obtained by libdvdcss.


OPTIONS
-------
*-V*::
	Print the version information and exit.

*-v*, *-q*::
	Increase or decrease the level of verbosity of messages printed to stderr.
	The default level is 1, at which only error messages are printed.  At level
	0 nothing is printed.  At level 2, a summary as well as some additional
	messages for noticeable events are printed.  At level 3, information about
	every processed sector is printed.

*-e*::
	Modify the exit status as if a read error occured when EOF is reached
	before the end of the given sector range.

*-o* 'output_file'::
	Write to the given file instead of the standard output.

*-a*::
	Open the output file in append mode.

*-k*::
	Key only mode: exit right after libdvdcss has tried to obtain the title key.


ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES
---------------------
DVDCSS_*::
	libdvdcss' environment variables.
	Setting `DVDCSS_VERBOSE=2` in the environment will make libdvdcss print the
	title key found.


FILES
-----
~/.dvdcss::
	libdvdcss' default cache directory for the title keys.  The cache is used
	only if the input 'target' is a DVD Video disc (or image file).  Setting
	`DVDCSS_CACHE=off` in the environment disables the use of the cache.


EXIT STATUS
-----------
To be interpreted as a bitmask, where each bit set indicates a failure.
Because a usage error always sets all the other bits, the values between 128
and 254 remain unused; they constitute a range often used by shells (e.g. bash
or older versions of ksh) to indicate an abnormal process termination (killed
by a signal).

*0*::
	No errors.

*255*::
	Usage error (invalid option or wrong number of arguments).

*127*::
	Failure while opening the 'target' or the 'output_file'.

*64*::
	I/O error, while reading or writing.

*32*::
	The title key could not be obtained.

*1*::
	Some sectors could be read but not decrypted.  The data corresponding to
	these sectors is output, but its content is unknown.


EXAMPLES
--------
Decrypt a scrambled video file:

[source,sh]
cp /media/dvd/VIDEO_TS/VTS_01_1.VOB scrambled.VOB
sectors=$( echo $(ls -l scrambled.VOB |cut -d' ' -f5) / 2048 | bc )
cssdec -ev scrambled.VOB 0 $sectors >descrambled.VOB

Decrypt a DVD Video title:

[source,sh]
for file in /media/cdrom/VIDEO_TS/VTS_01_[1-9].VOB; do
	cssdec $file >> title1.vob
done

Only print the title key:

[source,sh]
DVDCSS_VERBOSE=2 cssdec -kv scrambled.VOB


BUGS
----
If the file size is not a multiple of the sector size (2048 bytes), the last
partial sector is silently ignored.
