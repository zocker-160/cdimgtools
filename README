README for CDimg|tools
======================

CDimg|tools is a set of command line tools to inspect and manipulate CD/DVD
optical disc images of formats uncommon on free UNIX-like systems (like
GNU/Linux or BSD).

One sort of tool is concerned with a certain special image file format,
possibly a non open one.  It can print information about an image file in this
format, or extract parts of its data (e.g. audio tracks or disc sessions) to
files in ``raw'' format, so that they can be further processed by more widely
available tools (e.g. for the purpose of playing audio, reading files, burning
tracks or sessions to optical media).

* NRG is the only supported format for the present.

Another sort of tool is concerned with the processing of files in a ``raw''
format.  It can convert between different variations of formats of the same
type, or convert from a raw format to an equivalent well-known self-describing
format, or modify the raw data without changing its format.  For the present it
is possible:

* to demultiplex RAW+96 image files containing both stream data and sub-channel
  data,

* to decrypt CSS-scrambled VOB files,

* and to decrypt CSS-scrambled DVD Video image files.

CDimg|tools was mainly written under a GNU/Linux OS but should work under other
UNIX flavours, and perhaps even on other platforms, albeit maybe only partially
(see the file link:INSTALL.html['INSTALL'] for a list of dependencies).


Commands in the package
-----------------------

linkpage:raw96cdconv[1]::
	This command is a Perl script that demultiplexes/multiplexes stream data
	(audio, raw data or .iso format data) and sub-channel data from a RAW+96
	image file.  It handles optical disc images containing stream data and
	sub-channel data of a given sector at contiguous positions; this kind of
	image file may be either directly created by a ripping program like
	readcd(1) or cdrdao(1), or extracted from another image file by nrgtool(1).

linkpage:nrgtool[1]::
	This command is a Perl script that reads .nrg images (created by Nero),
	prints the metadata about the image, and extracts, for each track, the raw
	data to a separate file; disc types such as CDDA, CD-extra and
	(multi-session) CD-ROM/DVD-ROM are supported.

linkpage:cssdec[1]::
	This command decrypts CSS-scrambled VOB files or streams found on DVD Video
	discs; the title key is obtained transparently by libdvdcss.

linkpage:dvdimgdecss[1]::
	This command decrypts CSS-scrambled DVD Video discs or image files; it
	writes a similar image file containing the same data at the same location;
	the UDF filesystem of the disc is left intact.
